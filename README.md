## Sales Assistant Chatbot

This sales assistant chatbot helps users find products, add them to a shopping cart, and chat with an AI-powered assistant. The chatbot can search for products, suggest similar items, and keep track of selected products in a cart.

## About the Dataset

For this project, I chose the Online Retail dataset from Kaggle :DATA_URL = "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00352/Online%20Retail.xlsx"
The dataset contains real-world sales data from a UK-based online store, featuring stock codes for each product, descriptions of products, unit prices, and customer transactions. Since this dataset is rich in product information, itâ€™s perfect for training a chatbot that can help users find relevant products.

## Project Overview
This project is built using Python libraries for LangChain also Hugging Face API to generate chatbot responses, and FAISS db for product search. (RAG)

## How It Works
Users can chat with the assistant to ask about products.
The bot uses AI to understand queries and suggest relevant products.
Users can add products to a shopping cart using simple commands.
They can also view their cart before finalizing their purchase.
