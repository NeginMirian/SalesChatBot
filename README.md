Sales Assistant Chatbot
This is a sales assistant chatbot that helps users find products, add them to a shopping cart, and chat with an AI-powered assistant. The chatbot can search for products, suggest similar items, and keep track of selected products in a cart.

About the Dataset
For this project, I chose the Online Retail dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains real-world sales data from a UK-based online store, featuring stock codes for each product, descriptions of products, unit prices, and customer transactions. Since this dataset is rich in product information, itâ€™s perfect for training a chatbot that can help users find relevant products.

Project Overview
This project is built using Python and key libraries like LangChain for AI-powered conversations, Hugging Face API to generate chatbot responses, FAISS for fast product search, and Pandas for handling the dataset.

How It Works
Users can chat with the assistant to ask about products.
The bot uses AI to understand queries and suggest relevant products.
Users can add products to a shopping cart using simple commands.
They can also view their cart before finalizing their purchase.
